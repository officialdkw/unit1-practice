<p>Hello, I am DK. I am a husband, father, and community influencer. I'm excited to learn how to officially wite code after many years of building websites for my personal brand. It is my hope to become a software developer and travel/work remotely with my family. </p>
<h2 id="my-start">How I got my start.</h2>
<p>I started out working for Rocket as a client experience specialist and learned how to walk clients through the mortgage process. After a year of growing my personal business as a client specialist, I was promoted into technology as a business analyst to help drive technical solutions for my former business area. I absolutely loved being a BA and worked with stakeholders and software developers every day. This created a passion to drive change for clients and business partners through technology. I can't wait to learn more about code development and how to advance my career in technology as a software developer one day.</p>
<p>I chose to work at Grand Circus because of the partnership and recommendation of my former employer, Rocket. I have personally met people who have become software developers at Rocket and other places in Detroit upon finishing the coding bootcamp at Grand Cirus. It is my hope to follow in their footsteps. I'm excited for this journey!</p>
